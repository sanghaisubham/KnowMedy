                            Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis A study was conducted to find the relationship between tuberculosis and malnutrition. It was stated that infection may lead to under nutrition due to high metabolic demand and decrease intake. Search method was involved by reviewing central (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, mRCT, and the Indian Journal of Tuberculosis to July 2011. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies were selected where oral nutritional supplement was given for  four weeks with no nutritional intervention, placebo, or dietary advice only to people being treated for active tuberculosis. Twenty-three trials with 6842 participants, were included. Author concluded that there is insufficient research done to know whether routinely providing free food or energy supplements results in better tuberculosis treatment outcomes, or improved quality of life. Further trials with adequate sample sizes should be done to identify, or exclude, clinically important benefits. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006086.pub3/abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. . Tuberculosis commonly affects   the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It   spreads from person to person through the air, when people who are infected with TB infection cough, sneeze or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. It is a disease   that can be cured with proper treatment. India has the highest TB burden according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics for 2011, giving an estimated incidence of 2.2 million cases of TB  (India) out of a global incidence of 8.7 million cases.
